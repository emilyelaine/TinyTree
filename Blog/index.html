                        <h2>Best Yarn for Your Baby: Why Fiber Matters</h2>
                        <p>Repost from <a href="http://www.ebay.com/gds/How-to-Choose-Cotton-Yarn-for-a-Baby-Blanket-/10000000178722055/g.html">ebay</a></p>
                        
                        <p>Cotton is a great material for knitted baby blankets because it is soft and easy to wash. However, there are many different kinds of cotton yarn, and various cotton blends from which to choose. The brand names of various yarns seldom describe them very well. Knitters' forums are a good place to get recommendations for yarns, but these, too can seem confusing. Knitters' recommendations are likely to discuss different yarn characteristics at once, including some, such as color, that do not really make much difference to babies. The key is to focus on the characteristics that do matter to babies and their parents, such as softness and safety.</p>
                        <h3>Yarn Must Be Soft</h3>
                        <p>Babies have very sensitive skin and, unlike older people, they cannot do anything about it if their blankets scratch. Babies also are more sensitive to chemicals than are older people, so chemical residues or treatments such as fireproofing are easier for them to absorb. Untreated, organic cotton yarns are usually very light and soft, although there are exceptions.</p>
                        <p>Some blends, such as cotton with super wash merino wool, not other wools, or cotton-synthetic blends are softer than some pure cotton yarn. To be sure, knitters can touch the yarn to a sensitive part of their own skin, like the inside of the elbow, but touching a skein is not always the best indication of how a finished blanket would feel. Reading product reviews or talking to other knitters can help.</p>
                        <h3>Yarn Must Be Safe</h3>
                        <p>Pure, untreated cotton is extremely flammable. Blends that include synthetic fibers often melt if exposed to high heat. Wool is relatively flame-resistant naturally, and a blend that contains at least 40 to 60 percent wool usually has some flame-resistance.</p>
                        <p>Of course, some parents do not leave babies unattended with blankets at all because of a suffocation risk. Blankets are then play surfaces and swaddling, not sleepwear. For these families, the risk of fire is much lower because the adult is right there to grab the baby if there is a problem. Plain cotton is fine in such cases.</p>
                        <h3>Yarn Must Be Washable</h3>
                        <p>Parents of babies have no time or energy to hand-wash baby blankets. Pure cotton is usually safe for machine washing and it dries quickly. The same is true of many cotton blends. However, wool has a tendency to shrink, as does some wool and cotton blends. Super wash wool is pretreated to make it washable and is the only wool that is reliable for baby things. Synthetic yarns are all washable, as are all synthetic/cotton blends.</p>

                <h2>Sleeping Sacks and Combo Products</h2>
               
               <p> We are currently working on a variety of new products and patterns to share with you.  We wanted to give everyone a sneak peak of what's to come.  </p>
                <h3>Sleeping Sacks</h3>
                <p>Recently reported by <em>Maria Magher at LiveStrong:</em></p> 
                <blockquote>Swaddling helps many newborns to feel snug and secure, helping them to sleep better. As babies grow, they may become resistant to being swaddled. Some parents say that a sleep sack helps their baby to feel secure while also giving him a little more room to move his arms and legs. Sleep sacks can help these babies sleep better at night and ease the transition away from swaddling. Sleep sacks also help keep babies warm throughout the night, unlike a blanket, which may be kicked off or become wrapped around a baby's legs or midsection.</blockquote>
                <p>Keep your little one safe and warm while also staying stylish and adorable.  Our newest work-in-progress includes a narwhal and a shark.  The fins a purely decorative and are attached to the outside of the sleeping sack.  They will not interfere with the peaceful sleep of your child.  The hood is detachable for maximum cusomization.</p>

                <h3>Combo Pieces</h3>
                In the past we have mostly created onsies.  We wanted to branch out and create a few combo pieces that can be worn individually or together.  Hopefully this makes it a bit easier to put on and off and mix and match.  The two pieces currently being worked on include a tiger and a monkey.  The pieces include a sweaterd, pants and a hat.  These will be sold as a collection for now but if you would like to request a special order, please feel free to contact us under our <a href="../shop/specialrequests/">special requests</a> section!
